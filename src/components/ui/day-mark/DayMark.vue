<!--
  One day of one row (brand/design-system/project/components/DayMark): a 64px button centred in a
  76px square cell, drawing a hand-drawn box about 45px across in control-border. A marked day is
  drawn in its pen (green great, yellow partial, red missed) as the device's mark set says: the
  squiggles fill it with the marker drawing its mark names (zigzag, solid or hatch); a tick or face
  set strokes its symbol (tick, circle, cross; happy, so-so, sad), or stamps it, the box filled
  solid with the symbol in paper. The ink runs a little past the box, and the box is drawn over it,
  as a pen line shows through marker. The rest of the cell is quiet space, so the 2px focus ring at 2px
  offset never touches a neighbour.
