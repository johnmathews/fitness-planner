"""The port of src/lib/storage.ts's normalisers and src/lib/transfer.ts's parse and merge rules.

Each function mirrors its TypeScript namesake. Where Python's defaults differ from JavaScript's,
the code follows JavaScript: halves round up (`Math.round`), `True` is not a number, `NaN` is not
JSON, and week keys need ASCII digits with nothing after them. `tests/test_parity.py` runs the
shared fixtures in `fixtures/transfer/` to keep the two in step.
