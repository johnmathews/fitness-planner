# Development

> Purpose
>
> The toolchain, the scripts, the code conventions, the style guide and the design gate, and how
> the tests are organised.

## 1. Toolchain

- Node `^22.18.0 || >=24.12.0` (from `engines` in `package.json`). CI runs Node 22.
- **npm 11.** npm 10.9, which ships with Node 22, crashes during install with
  `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'edgesOut')` while resolving this dependency tree's peer
  sets. Install npm 11 first (`npm install -g npm@11`) or run it ad hoc with
  `npx -y npm@11 install`. CI and the Dockerfile both do the former.
- Vue 3.5, Pinia 4, Vite 8, Tailwind CSS 4, TypeScript 6, Vitest 4 with jsdom, ESLint 10 + oxlint,
  Prettier with `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`.
- The UI layer: shadcn-vue components on Reka UI 2 (owned source in `src/components/ui/`),
  Lucide icons (`@lucide/vue`), and the Source Serif 4 and Source Sans 3 Fontsource variable
  packages. The design system's scripts (`scripts/check_design_system.py`,
  `scripts/design_preview.py`) need only Python 3's standard library.
- Running the app needs the API: the README's Getting started shows how. `npm run dev` forwards
  `/api` to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (`API_URL` overrides it), so the browser sees one origin as it
  does behind nginx. `scripts/compose-smoke.sh` runs both images together and checks them through
  nginx.
- The API in `api/` uses Python 3.13 with uv, FastAPI, pytest with coverage, ruff and mypy
  (strict). [api.md](api.md) §10 has its commands. Its tests run the same `fixtures/transfer/` cases
  as Vitest, so a validation rule changed in `src/lib/storage.ts` must change in
  `api/src/fitness_planner_api/validate.py` too, and the reverse.

## 2. Scripts

| Script                            | Does                                                                        |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`                     | Vite dev server with Vue devtools                                           |
| `npm run build`                   | `type-check` and `build-only` in parallel; either failing fails it          |
| `npm run build-only`              | `vite build` into `dist/` without type-checking (CI runs it last)           |
| `npm run preview`                 | serve `dist/`                                                               |
| `npm test`                        | run the Vitest suite once                                                   |
| `npm run test:watch`              | Vitest in watch mode                                                        |
| `npm run test:coverage`           | suite plus v8 coverage (per-file text table, HTML in `coverage/`)           |
| `npm run type-check`              | `vue-tsc --build` across the app, node and test configs                     |
| `npm run lint`                    | `lint:oxlint` then `lint:eslint`, read-only (CI runs this)                  |
| `npm run lint-fix`                | both linters with `--fix`                                                   |
| `npm run format` / `format:check` | Prettier over `src/`, `fixtures/`, `e2e/` and `playwright.config.ts`        |
| `npm run tokens`                  | regenerate `src/styles/tokens.css` from the design system's tokens          |
| `npm run test:e2e`                | the Playwright browser checks in `e2e/` against their own dev server (§3.3) |

The linters ignore `design_handoff_exercise_planner/`, which holds vendored prototype code, and
build and coverage output. ESLint also ignores Playwright's `playwright-report/` and
`test-results/`.

## 3. Conventions

- Prettier (`.prettierrc.json`): no semicolons, single quotes, print width 100. The Tailwind plugin
  sorts class lists in templates. It reads the theme from `src/styles/main.css`. `.prettierignore`
  keeps it off the generated `src/styles/tokens.css`. `.editorconfig` sets indentation for
  editors, and `.vscode/extensions.json` recommends the Vue and lint extensions.
- `@/` resolves to `src/` in Vite (`vite.config.ts`) and TypeScript (`tsconfig.app.json`).
- Components use `<script setup lang="ts">` and Tailwind utility classes, with no `<style>` blocks.
  A class list used more than once in a component goes in a constant in its script.
- **Role utilities only.** Colours come from the roles (`bg-canvas`, `text-ink-secondary`,
  `border-control-border`, `text-pen`), never a palette class, a hex value or an arbitrary colour.
  The palette is switched off, so a class such as `bg-red-500` silently draws nothing.
  [brand.md](brand.md) §3 says what each role means. `pen` is for done and a met day, nothing else.
  `caution-ink` is kept for InlineMessage's caution tone; nothing on the planner uses it (K28).
- **Type-style classes for text.** Set text with `display`, `title-1`, `title-2`, `body-large`,
  `body`, `caption`, `label` or `note`, rather than font-size and line-height utilities. The type
  classes sit in Tailwind's `components` layer, so a utility beside one wins as it reads
  (`caption font-semibold` is semibold): add one only where a card asks for it. Numbers take
  `tabular-nums`.
- **Primitives before raw elements.** Use the components in `src/components/ui/` (Button,
  IconButton, TextField, Dialog, `useConfirm`) rather than a raw `<button>`, `<input>` or
  `window.confirm`. A component the system lacks starts as a card, then a primitive
  ([brand.md](brand.md) §10).
- **Icons** are Lucide (`@lucide/vue`) at `:stroke-width="1.5"`, 20px in buttons and 16px beside
  text, never a Unicode glyph or emoji. An icon-only button is an IconButton with a `label`.
- **Ids.** TextField and TextArea forward `id` (and `inputmode`, `autocomplete`, `data-*`) to the
  real control, and generate an id with Vue's `useId()` when none is given. Pass a fixed `id` only
  where a test or another element needs it (the sign-in, sign-up and link forms).
- Tests find elements by role, label, `data-testid`, `data-slot` or state attributes (`data-today`,
  `data-tone`, `data-met`, `data-shown`, `aria-pressed`, `aria-current`), never by styling classes.

### 3.1 The style guide

`npm run dev` serves the living style guide at <http://localhost:5173/styleguide>: every primitive
and planner component, in each state, rendered by its real source. Its Theme menu switches the
look, and the address keeps it (`/styleguide?theme=dark`), so a link or a browser test opens
either theme. It needs no API and no sign-in, and the production build leaves it out.
Add a section for each new component in `src/styleguide/sections/` and one entry in
`src/styleguide/sections.ts`.

### 3.2 The design gate and the tokens

The design system's source is `brand/design-system/` ([brand.md](brand.md)). After any change to
it, run the gate, which must exit 0:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_design_system.py brand/design-system --complete
```

It checks contrast in both themes for every role pair, the three pens included, the token shapes, the banned words,
and that every required component has a card. After a change to `tokens.json`, regenerate the app's
tokens with `npm run tokens` and commit `src/styles/tokens.css` with it. Never edit that file by
hand.

### 3.3 Lint rules, e2e suite and CI checks

`npm run lint` enforces the conventions above, so a break fails CI rather than review:

- **Tailwind classes** (`eslint-plugin-better-tailwindcss`, read against `src/styles/main.css`): an
  unknown class fails, and with the default palette switched off `bg-red-500` is unknown. So do
  conflicting, duplicate and deprecated classes, an arbitrary colour (`bg-[#…]`, `text-[rgb(…)]`)
  and a colour utility on a raw variable (`bg-[var(--canvas)]`). The type styles (`caption`,
  `title-2`, …) are known because `tokens.css` is imported into the `components` layer, which also
  lets a utility beside them win (`caption font-semibold` is semibold).
- **Template accessibility** (`eslint-plugin-vuejs-accessibility`, recommended rules): a click
  handler on a non-interactive element, a control without a label, and so on. The explicit grid roles
  on `tr` and `th` are allowed, since `gridNav` and the specs find cells by role. Two lines disable a
  rule with a reason: the hidden username field password managers use (`PasswordForm.vue`) and the
  Stepper's live-region `<output>`.
- **Single-word names** are kept where the design system or shadcn-vue gives them: Banner, Button,
  Chip, Dialog, Popover, Stepper and Switch in `src/components/ui/` each open with a comment that
  disables `vue/multi-word-component-names` and says whose name it is.
- **No `<style>` blocks** in components (`vue/no-restricted-block`): styling is utilities on roles.

`npm run test:e2e` runs the Playwright suite in `e2e/` against its own dev server (port 5179, with
`PLAYWRIGHT=1`, which turns the Vue DevTools overlay off). `/api` is mocked with `page.route` and the
clock is fixed to Wednesday 21 October 2026, so every run sees the same week.

- `a11y.spec.ts`: axe (WCAG 2.0–2.2 A and AA plus best practice) on the style guide in both themes,
  and on the app's (its mocked week holds every kind of mark) week view, the bar called up, Edit plan, open Settings, the folded week at 375px,
  sign-in, and create an account (empty and with errors showing), in light and dark; and the focus ring's shape, a solid 2px outline at 2px offset. Two
  "dark really is dark" tests guard the audit: on the style guide and on the app, the `.dark` class
  must be set and `--canvas` must differ from light, so a dark audit can never quietly re-run
  light.
- `phone.spec.ts`: no sideways scroll at 375px on the style guide, sign-in, create an account, and
  the folded week and Edit plan, and every cell of the folded week stays on screen as the keyboard
  walks it. `callUpBar` in `support.ts` brings the navbar into view before a test presses its
  controls, since on the planner's screens it is out of sight.
- `screens.spec.ts`: a tall Exercises screen and a tall Food screen (`openApp`'s `moreExercises`
  and `moreFoods`), wheel-scrolled down and back up a notch at a time at 1280×800: the page never
  rests showing part of both, and it reaches Food (K38); a rotation (and back, and a phone on
  its side) never leaves it resting across two screens (K40); and a short trackpad fling reaches
  Food before the fling has ended (K45).

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs three jobs on every pull request and every push to `main`.
`check` runs lint, format, types, unit tests with coverage, the build, the design gate and
"tokens.css is current" (`npm run tokens` followed by
`git diff --exit-code src/styles/tokens.css`). `e2e` installs Chromium and runs `npm run test:e2e`,
keeping traces of a failure. `api` checks the Python service. One convention has no check yet: unit
tests should not query styling classes.

## 4. Tests

The app's tests sit in `__tests__/` next to the code they cover (the API's are in `api/tests/`,
listed in [api.md](api.md) §10):

- `src/lib/__tests__/dates.spec.ts`: Monday maths, offsets, year boundary, the 2026-10-25 week (a
  DST change in EU timezones), labels.
- `src/lib/__tests__/storage.spec.ts`: v2 plan validation and round-trip, migration from the v1
  (prototype) format, log normalisation, sets and weight, diet parsing, settings parsing,
  skip-unchanged writes, storage that throws.
- `src/lib/__tests__/plans.spec.ts`: which week's plan a week shows (own, carried forward, earliest,
  none) and plan copies.
- `src/composables/__tests__/exerciseForm.spec.ts`: digits-only sets/reps and decimal weight
  cleaning, loading and resetting the shared exercise form.
- `src/lib/__tests__/transfer.spec.ts`: every case in `fixtures/transfer/` (parsing an export and
  merging one), plus building an export, the merge summary and the download. Add a fixture rather
  than an inline case when the behaviour is part of the export contract: the API's tests
  (`api/tests/test_parity.py`) read the same files.
- `fixtures/transfer/sample/`: `storage.json` is a realistic `localStorage` snapshot. It spans five
  weeks (2026-09-21 to 2026-10-19): four with data, and 2026-09-28 left empty so it carries the
  plan before it forward. It has plans edited over time (sets, weights, Back extensions removed,
  Plank added), 102 ticks, a diet with an added food, and non-default settings. `export.json` is
  the export it must produce. `App.spec.ts` seeds the snapshot and checks Export gives
  `export.json`. It also imports `export.json` into an empty account and checks the cache and the
  (fake) server both end up holding the sample, with the theme left on the device. To see the app populated while
  developing, import `fixtures/transfer/sample/export.json` from Settings → Import… on a scratch
  origin. Tests read fixtures through `src/lib/__tests__/fixtures.ts`.
- `src/lib/__tests__/tracker.spec.ts`: the shared tick-per-day helpers (totals, day counts, goals
  met, toggling, ids), including that `toggleDay` changes a reactive log through its proxy.
- `src/lib/__tests__/api.spec.ts`: how every kind of reply becomes a typed result (success, 204,
  401 for an ended session versus a wrong password, a 409 `conflict` versus any other 409 (a
  refusal with its code), gateway errors and network failures as
  offline, the API's own refusals with `Retry-After`).
- `src/lib/__tests__/nginx.spec.ts`: reads `nginx.conf`: the CSP is unchanged, and `/api/` proxies
  to `fitness-api:8000` through a variable upstream with the body cap and one `Cache-Control`.
- `src/lib/__tests__/fakeApi.ts` (a helper, not a spec): an in-memory API installed as `fetch`. It
  keeps plan revisions and 409s, identical-item creates, single-day marks (in the API's three masks,
  and the old `done` body), settings, sessions,
  sign-up (`email`, `password` and `exists` refusals) and invite links. Controls let a test go offline, fail the next matching request, `hold()` every
  reply, `holdNext()` one, or `stall()` one forever. `signedIn.ts` sets up a browser already signed
  in as alice: the fake API, the remembered session, and an empty or given cache.
- `src/lib/__tests__/theme.spec.ts`: theme names and how System, Light and Dark resolve.
- `src/lib/__tests__/words.spec.ts`: small numbers as words (capitalised to open a sentence),
  singular and plural, and the app name with its monogram.
- `src/lib/__tests__/utils.spec.ts`: `cn` (conflicting utilities, role colours kept apart from text
  sizes) and `joinIds`.
- `src/composables/__tests__/useConfirm.spec.ts`: the question, its verb and Cancel, true and false
  answers, Escape, focus returned, a newer question answering an older one false, and an open
  question answered false when the component that asked goes away or `dismissConfirm()` runs.
- `src/composables/__tests__/useMediaQuery.spec.ts`: the media query's match, its updates, the
  listener removed with the scope, and a browser without `matchMedia`.
- `src/composables/__tests__/screenSprint.spec.ts`: where a scroll goes (`sprintTarget`: nowhere
  inside a screen, on in the direction of travel across a line, to the larger screen with no
  direction, and only past a step when given one) and the composable: a moving scroll sprinting at
  once, a short one after a pause, a finger waiting to lift, the wheel swallowed during and after,
  the eased `sprintTo`, a resize, reduced motion and switching off (K38, K40, K45).
- `src/composables/__tests__/fullscreen.spec.ts`: full screen unsupported (an iPhone), entering and
  leaving it, and a refusal leaving the page as it is (K34).
- `src/styles/__tests__/print.spec.ts`: the print block's literal colours match `tokens.json`'s light
  values, and the surfaces go transparent.
- `src/composables/__tests__/gridNav.spec.ts`: the grid keyboard model on a small table: the one
  tab stop (today, the first day, the last cell focused), arrows, Home and End with and without
  Ctrl, Space and Enter left to the DayMark, Edit plan's
  controls (Enter or F2 in, Escape out, parked when focus leaves), and rows coming and going.
- `src/components/ui/__tests__/`: one spec per primitive (Banner, BrandMark, Button, Chip,
  ConfirmDialog, DayMark, Dialog, IconButton, InlineMessage, Popover, RadioCard, SectionHeader,
  SegmentedControl, Stepper, Switch, TextArea, TextField, TextLink), each checking its
  roles, accessible names, sizes, states and the role colours its card names. Examples: an
  IconButton renders nothing without a label, the Popover closes when focus leaves it (F14), the
  Stepper's limits stay focusable with `aria-disabled`.
  `transitions.spec.ts` checks no primitive animates `outline-color`, so the focus ring never fades
  in. `setup.ts` fills the jsdom gaps Reka UI's overlays reach for.
- `src/styleguide/__tests__/look.spec.ts`: the style guide's theme from the query string, the
  round trip back to it, and the class it sets.
- `src/stores/__tests__/planner.spec.ts`: stepping a day through its marks, totals, week navigation, goal clamping, adding,
  removal's effect on totals, settings, detail chips, editing exercises, sets, weekly plans
  (defaults, carry forward, a week getting its own plan, copying to the next week), config mode,
  the midnight refresh, `adopt`, `adoptWeek` and `clear`, the theme being the only thing stored
  (merged into the settings key), the keys from before accounts never being written, and
  `savedSettings` (tracked in memory, set by adopting or changing settings, never by the theme).
- `src/stores/__tests__/diet.spec.ts`: food toggling in the planner's week, shared week navigation,
  goal clamping, add/remove, carrying and copying food plans, `adopt`, `adoptWeek` and `clear`, the
  old diet keys never being written.
- `src/stores/__tests__/sync.spec.ts`: the sync store against the fake API:
  - the cache shown at once, then the server's state; no cache, or a broken one;
  - a first tick creating the week's plan before the tick, and revisions carried forward;
  - diet and settings writes, and a toggle made while its write is in flight;
  - offline queueing, the backing-off retry timer, gateway errors as offline, and 401s handing
    control back;
  - conflicts (taking the server's copy with a notice, re-creating when the server has none, no
    notice for identical creates), and refused writes being dropped (with the account-full notice
    for `quota`);
  - reads that must not undo local edits, including one the watcher has not seen;
  - other tabs' cache and outbox writes, stop and forget, the old keys never written, `diff` and
    `normaliseState`;
  - `importFile`: queued writes first, then one server import and a read; offline, refused, a
    full account (`quota`), 401, and nobody signed in.
- `src/lib/__tests__/problems.spec.ts`: the sentence for every sign-in, sign-up, link and sign-out refusal,
  including the minutes left on a lockout.
- `src/lib/__tests__/legacy.spec.ts`: reading the keys from before accounts (v2, the v1 migration,
  the accent and daily pick but never the theme, broken JSON, nothing worth offering).
- `src/components/__tests__/ImportPrompt.spec.ts`: the first-login prompt through the app: what it
  offers, Add (merged on the fake server, shown, remembered), Not mine, Later, offline, refused and
  over-quota imports, an account that already holds everything, a browser with no earlier log, waiting for
  the account's state, and per-user answers.
- `src/stores/__tests__/session.spec.ts`: sign-in from a remembered user (online, offline, ended), a
  still-valid cookie, switching user, every login refusal, invite links, sign-out forgetting the
  device's data, and sign-out refused offline.
- `src/components/__tests__/App.spec.ts`: the mounted app in jsdom. Covers rendering, the today
  column, stepping a cell through its marks with `aria-pressed` (a food only on and off), the goal stepper and its bounds,
  navigation, confirm-before-remove, print, the visibility and one-minute clock refresh, another
  tab's writes to the cache, the add form, the Settings page (the hash, focus on arrival and on the way back; no Ink setting, and a saved accent kept as it is), and the
  theme: the `dark` class following the OS (with a stubbed `matchMedia`), the theme control and
  its persistence. Also the weight and sets fields, the edit dialog (found by `role="dialog"` on
  `document.body`, where Reka's portal renders it), normal mode hiding every editing control, export (with
  `URL.createObjectURL` stubbed) and import through the file input (summary, confirm, cancel,
  errors), copying the plan to
  the next week (with and without the replace confirmation), and the carried-over note. Tests that
  edit the plan mount with `mountConfig()`, which turns config mode on. Queries that would also
  match the diet grid scope to `[data-testid="exercise-grid"]`; the rest rely on exercise-only
  labels or on the exercise form coming first in the DOM. Every mount is signed in as alice through
  `signedIn()`.
- `src/components/__tests__/Auth.spec.ts`: the sign-in form and its messages, an ended session, a
  double submit, creating an account (the link from sign-in, signing in by email, matching
  passwords, each refusal on its field or the form, offline, a double submit, back to sign in, and
  `#/signup` while signed in), invite and reset links (matching passwords, the length rule, expired links, a link
  pasted into a running tab), sign-out (with unsynced changes, and refused offline), and the sync
  status messages and triggers (loading, offline with and without a copy, retry, the conflict
  notice, focus, visibility and the minute tick).
- `src/components/__tests__/Planner.spec.ts`: the planner on the design system's marks, in the
  mounted app: a day that meets the daily pick (its name, check, words and underline, K30, K39),
  today (full-date names with "today", `aria-current`, no band, K36), rows with no goal or total
  (K33), Edit plan's rows (Edit in the name
  cell, Remove in its own last column, stable row height, focus after a removal), the keyboard (one tab stop per grid,
  arrows, the skip link, the arrows between the screens, Edit plan's controls), and headings and print
  attributes. The layouts themselves (filling, folding, the out-of-sight navbar) depend on media
  queries jsdom doesn't apply, so the e2e suite covers them.
- `src/components/__tests__/Email.spec.ts`: Forgot your password? (offered only when the planner
  sends email, the same words whatever the answer, a malformed email, one request however often
  it's pressed) and confirming an email (the banner, Send it again, too soon, already confirmed,
  the link while signed in).
- `src/components/__tests__/PlannerScreen.spec.ts`: the planner's screens in the mounted app (K24–K27):
  the `planner-screens` class and Edit plan's sticky bar, the bar from the top edge (a pointer,
  not a finger), the handle's press and pull, a press elsewhere and Escape hiding it, and the way
  on to Food.
- `src/components/__tests__/DietSection.spec.ts`: the diet section in the mounted app: default
  foods, ticking (totals checked in the store), shared week navigation, add and remove (after
  a confirmation) and the goal set in the Edit food dialog (in config mode), cross-tab sync.

`vitest.config.ts` sets coverage thresholds (100% lines and functions, 99% statements, 98%
branches), so `npm run test:coverage` and CI fail when coverage drops below them. Coverage covers
`src/` except `src/main.ts`, the tests themselves and the development-only `src/styleguide/`. The
copied shadcn-vue source in `src/components/ui/` counts like any other code.

Every test that depends on the date pins the clock with `vi.useFakeTimers({ toFake: ['Date'] })`
(the minute-tick test also fakes `setInterval`), and all tests build dates with local-time
constructors, so they pass in any timezone. The browser checks are in §3.3.
